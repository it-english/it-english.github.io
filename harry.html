<h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The play begins where the epilogue of  <em><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>  left off, when Harry and Ginny drop off their children at the Hogwarts Express. Harry’s oldest son James is taunting his brother, Albus Potter. He tells Albus that he might be sorted into Slytherin, a Hogwarts house all the Dark wizards were sorted into, including  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#lord-voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. Albus stares at platforms Nine and Ten, before his mother told him that, in order to reach the right platform, he only has to walk straight into the wall. His father tells that he can’t be scared or stop because he will crash. Harry, Lily, and Albus run into the wall transporting them to platform 9 ¾.</p>
<p>The platform is filled with Hogwarts students and their families. Harry’s daughter, Lily, looks around for Ron, her favorite uncle. He arrives and shows her a trick from his joke shop Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, causing embarrassment to his daughter, Rose. Before boarding the train, Albus asks his father what he would think of him if he was sorted into Slytherin. He tells him that he was named after two headmasters of Hogwarts,  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#albus-dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>  and  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#severus-snape">Severus Snape</a>, the bravest men that he ever knew, and one was a Slytherin. And if it mattered to him he could always ask the Sorting Hat to place him in Gryffindor like it did for him at Hogwarts. Albus is relieved and boards the train. Harry tells Hermione about Albus’s worries. She tells him that Rose is worried about breaking the Quidditch scoring record during her first or second year and how early can she take the O.W.L.s.</p>
<p>On the way to Hogwarts, the  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#trolley-witch">Trolley Witch</a>  asks Albus and Rose if they want anything from the candy trolley. Albus locks eyes on a chocolate frog, but Rose tells him that he needs to concentrate on making friends on the train since their parents met on their first train ride to Hogwarts. Albus opens a door to find a compartment with one blond kid. It turns out to be  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#scorpius-malfoy">Scorpius Malfoy</a>; he tells them that the seats are empty and offers them his sweets. Albus accepts the sweets, but Rose wants to leave the compartment because Scorpius’s father was a Death Eater, and rumor has it that Scorpius’ true father was Voldemort. Albus learns the details of the rumor: that Scorpius’s parents could not conceive a child, so Draco and Lucius Malfoy used a Time-Turner to send Draco’s wife Astoria to the past where she became pregnant with Voldemort’s son. Still, Albus stays with Scorpius. Scorpius thanks him for staying but Albus tells him that he stayed for his sweets.</p>
<p>The First-Year students enter the Great Hall where the Sorting Ceremony is about to start. The students look at Albus, happy that they have a Potter in their year. Rose overhears them and tells them that Albus is her cousin. The Sorting Hat calls  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#rose-granger-weasley">Rose Granger-Weasley</a>  and she is sorted into Gryffindor, like the rest of her family. Then it calls Scorpius Malfoy and places him in Slytherin; his entire family has been sorted into Slytherin. Lastly, it calls Albus Potter, but the hat takes a longer time to sort him. Finally, it sorts him into Slytherin. The students are shocked. Albus joins the rest of the Slytherin students; Scorpius is excited to have someone that he knows in his house.</p>
<p>We begin a montage sequence that speeds up the passage of time. The scene transitions to  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#madam-hooch">Madam Hooch</a>’s flying lesson; the students are ordered to yell “ip” to lift up the brooms. On the first try, Rose and Yann Fredericks successfully lift their brooms; Albus can’t move his broom at all. The rest of the classmates say that Albus was a humiliation for  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>.</p>
<p>The scene changes to Platform 9 3/4 a year later. Albus tells Harry to stand far away because he doesn’t want people comparing him to his father. Harry asks him if it might help to have friends like Ron and Hermione, but Albus tells him that he already has a friend, Scorpius, and departs.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#draco-malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>  appears and tells Harry to release a statement by the Ministry of Magic stating that all of the Time-Turners were destroyed during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Harry explains to him that he needs to let the rumor about Scorpius’ parentage die on its own since he isn’t the first person to be accused of being Voldemort’s son.</p>
<p>At Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall announces Rose Granger-Weasley as the new Quidditch Chaser for the Gryffindor House. Meanwhile, by contrast, in Potion class, Albus and Scorpius are brewing a potion, which explodes in their face, causing the students to laugh at him. Later, Harry is leaving his son in his third year and handing him his signed Hogsmeade permission slip. Albus told his father that he hates that place because it will be filled with Hogwarts students. Harry tells him that if agrees to go, he can make a trip to Honeydukes and eat all the sweets that he wants without his mother’s permission; Albus crumples up the paper and sets it on fire. Harry tells him that he has been exchanging owls to McGonagall, in which she tells him that his son has been isolating himself and being uncooperative in lessons. He asks his father if he can conjure a spell to make him popular or be more skilled in magic, something to make his life better. Before Harry can respond, Albus runs to Scorpius and gets on the train. On the train, Scorpius tells him that his mother died during the vacation and asks him to come to the funeral. Then the Sorting Hat sorts his younger sister Lily Potter into Gryffindor house, further isolating Albus from his family.</p>
<p>At the Ministry of Magic, Harry enters his messy office, where he finds Hermione looking around his paperwork. She asks him if the rumor of Theodore Nott possessing a Time-Turner was true. He proves its existence when he revealed his Time-Turner, this device is unlike the one Hermione owned during his Third year. This Time-Turner can send its user into the past for more than an hour at a time. Hermione asks why isn’t he on top of his paperwork, and he explains he is getting his information from the streets, including the Theodore Nott story. Hermione changes the subject, asking Harry if he wants a toffee, which Harry declines because he is off sugar. Hermione asks about Ginny and his children, and he replies that he is as good at being a father as he at organizing his paperwork. She tells him to go home to his family because the Hogwarts Express is about to depart for another year.</p>
<p>Harry is visited by  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#amos-diggory">Amos Diggory</a>  in his home, after Harry kept delaying appointments with him. Harry apologizes but Amos reminds him that he is responsible for the death of his son Cedric, because Lord Voldemort intended to kill Harry, not Cedric. He asks Harry to bring back his son, which Harry says is impossible. But Amos said that a rumor around town is that the Ministry seized an illegal Time-Turner, so he wants him to use it to save his son. Harry tells him that it’s too dangerous to mess with time. Meanwhile, A girl appears next to Albus, who overheard the conversation. She introduces herself as  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  Diggory, niece of Amos. Delphi takes care of her Uncle at St. Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and Wizards.</p>
<p>On holiday, Albus sits on his bed and overhears his brother talking about hiding himself with the Invisibility Cloak since his hair is now pink and Lily is laughing about her new fairy wings. Then Harry enters his room with gifts for his son. He got a love potion from his Uncle Ron, and he gives Albus a blanket. It was the blanket in which Harry was wrapped when Dumbledore, McGonagall, and  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#hagrid">Hagrid</a>  first left him in Privet Drive. When his Aunt Petunia died, his cousin Dudley found it and sent it to him, so anytime that he wanted luck he grabs it and wants Albus to have it for luck also. Albus said that he needed the luck, but he thinks that his father should keep it. Harry tells him that he really wants him to have it, but Albus aggressively responds by asking him what he’s going to do with it. He gave James a cloak of Invisibility and Lily some fairy wings, but he didn’t understand why he gave him an old, moldy blanket. Then he tells his father that he needs to pack for tomorrow. Harry asks if he needs help; Harry always enjoyed packing, because it meant that he was leaving to Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts; Albus interrupts him, completing his sentence, and tell him he’s tired of listening to the same story. He saved the Wizarding World! Wow! Albus mockingly offers his gratitude, but Harry says that he never wanted gratitude. Harry says he’s tired of feeling responsible for his son’s unhappiness and that he should be happy to at least have a dad, since Harry himself didn’t have one. Albus asks if he felt that not having a father was unlucky because in his case he didn’t. Harry asks him if he wishes that he was dead, Albus says no, but sometimes wishes that he wasn’t his father. Harry replies that sometimes he wishes Albus wasn’t his son. He then retracts his comment, but Albus knows that he truly meant it. He tells him to leave his room, Harry tries to talk to him, but Albus grabs the blanket and throws it on the floor, knocking over Ron’s love potion and spilling all over the blanket.</p>
<p>We see a dream Harry is having the night when Hagrid tells him that he is a wizard. We see Harry hiding in a lighthouse with his Aunt, Uncle, and his cousin when Hagrid arrives with a birthday cake and his Hogwarts letter. He asks what Hogwarts was and Hagrid tells him that it was a school for witches and wizards. The dream is interrupted by the voice of Voldemort calling his name, and he wakes up.</p>
<p>Ginny asks if he had a nightmare. He tells her yes; it was about the Dursleys, but it later became something dark. He tells her that he said some bad things to Albus, she says she knows and she also knows that with time Albus will forgive his father. The only thing that Harry can do is be honest with his son. He then tells her that he wishes that Albus was more like James or Lily. He then feels a sharp pain on his forehead, she asked him if his scar hurts he replies yes, and that it hasn’t since twenty-two years ago.</p>
<h2 id="analysis"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>For all of their supposed differences, Harry and Albus actually reveal that they have many things in common in the opening scene: both of them were worried that they would be sorted into Slytherin, because it’s known to be the house of dark wizards. However, Harry tells him that he could decide his house and the Sorting Hat would listen to his decision. Highlighting the difference between the two, because we know the Sorting Hat takes the will of the wearing into consideration, we can assume Albus was sorted into Slytherin somewhat consciously. He accepts his fate, remembering that his father told him that it wouldn’t make a difference to him if he wasn’t sorted into Gryffindor. Ironically, Gryffindor is the house of bravery, but Albus’s middle name originates from Severus Snape, a Slytherin, who according to his father was the bravest man that he ever met.</p>
<p>The success of Rose Granger-Weasley becomes an excellent foil for the failures of Albus. We see him make totally different decisions from her. She advises him not to ally himself with Scorpius, but he befriends him anyway. As she is sorted into Gryffindor, he is sorted into Slytherin. As she succeeds in Flying Lessons, he fails. As she is praised as the young new Chaser, he is shown to be a failure in his potion class. This juxtaposition highlights her success as a traditional Hogwarts student like Harry was, and Albus’s own failure to measure up.</p>
<p>Albus not wanting to go to Hogsmade, the Hogwarts village, highlights the differences between the father and son, not because of their separate houses, but because of Albus’s own lack of popularity. Harry in his third year wanted to go to Hogsmade, but was unable to go because his Uncle Vernon refused to sign his permission slip. For Albus, as an outcast, Hogwarts is every bit as miserable as Privet Drive. Furthering his isolation, Lily Potter is sorted into Gryffindor, which makes Albus the only Slytherin in the family.</p>
<p>The rumor of a Time-Turner existing in this section is what Anton Chekov calls the “gun” of the play (if there’s a gun introduced, it’s going to go off at some point in the play.) We know that this Time-Turner will be found and used at some point. The Time-Turner is a plot device used in the third Harry Potter book,  <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban</em>. It allows the user to return to the past and be in two places at once.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#hermione-granger">Hermione Granger</a>  received one in her third year at Hogwarts from Professor McGonagall, so she could take more classes in one year. She was warned in the novel not to change the past. Normal Time-Turners allow the user to travel back at most five hours in the past; Theodore Nott’s Time-Turner allows traveler to go back decades. The foreshadowing makes us expect that the play will feature long-term time travel.</p>
<p>The most dramatic scene involves Harry giving his children each a gift before going to Hogwarts. He gives his eldest son his Invisibility Cloak, but for Harry the most personal gift was his childhood blanket, the only thing he has to remember his parents. Albus, feeling self-conscious about being his father’s least favorite, despises the gift because to him it feels like an empty gift compared to the gifts given to his other siblings. Albus always thought that Harry liked James more, because James was more like himself. The irony is that in many ways Albus and Harry both struggled; Harry might have been famous, but often that gained him negative attention rather than allowing him to ease through life, as James seems to be able to do.</p>
<h1 id="act-one-scene-10-19">Act One, Scene 10-19</h1>
<h2 id="summary-1"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>On the Hogwarts Express Rose finds Albus; she says that since it’s their fourth year, she wants to be friends again. He tells her that they were never friends, they’re cousins and have known each other since they were six years old. She changes the subject by telling him that she heard that her father confiscated an illegal Time-Turner from a wizard called Theodore Nott. Albus finds Scorpius, who awkwardly compliments the smell of Rose’s hair (“flowers and fresh bread”). Rose leaves and Albus hugs his friend; he tells him that they have to get off the train. Scorpius tells him that it’s too late since the train already left the train station. Albus tells him that they have to jump from the train. Albus begins asking Scorpius about the Tri-wizard Tournament, a tournament in which three schools pick three champions to compete in different tasks. The last tournament was celebrated in Hogwarts, where  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>  and a boy named  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>  were among the competitors. During the last task, they both decided to win the tournament together by grabbing a Cup, which transported them to the ceremony Voldemort was enacting in order to return to power. Cedric is killed, because Voldemort only wanted Harry Potter and had no use for Cedric. Albus tells Scorpius that he is going to use a Time-Tuner to save Cedric. Scorpius thinks it’s crazy, but is persuaded.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius are on the roof of the train, which is at full speed. Albus comes up with the idea to jump from the train into the viaduct using a Cushioning Charm. Scorpius sees the  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#trolley-witch">Trolley Witch</a>  get up to the roof; she tells them her job is to make all the sweets and Pumpkin Pasties—which can also turn into grenades, if anyone tries to escape before arriving at the destination. She fires a grenade and it explodes, and she tells them that she has never let any Hogwarts students leave the train before their destination. She recommends that they return to their seats. Then the Trolley Witch’s hands began transfiguring into sharp spikes. Albus casts the Cushioning Charm and jumps of the train; Scorpius hesitates but follows.</p>
<p>Hermione is trying to call order in a crowed Ministry meeting. She reminds them that the wizarding community has been living in peace for many years now. Harry informs them that Voldemort’s allies have been showing movements for many months now. Professor McGonagall reveals that during the summer some potion stores had been reported missing, but nothing from the Restricted section. Hermione tells them that recently Harry’s scar began hurting again. They crowd reacts, and Harry asks if those with the Dark Mark had felt anything recently. Draco is offended, speculating that Harry only wants to have his face back in the newspaper. Harry defends himself since these rumors did not come from him. Hermione tells him that as Minister for Magic she has to take these things seriously; Draco offends her by telling her that she only got the job because she is friends with Harry Potter. Ron is ready to punch Draco, but Draco protests that he only wants to protect his son Scorpius from the gossip that will result when people start to say that Voldemort might be back. Harry reminds him that this has nothing to do with his son. When everyone leaves, Hermione tells them to come back because they need to think of a strategy.</p>
<p>Scorpius and Albus arrive at St. Oswald’s.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  appears and takes them to meet Amos. In  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#amos-diggory">Amos Diggory</a>’s room, Albus tells him that his father lied to him about having a Time-Tuner, and that they are going to use it to save Cedric. When Amos is skeptical of two underage boys on the mission, Albus reminds him that his father was a teenager when he saved the wizarding world. Albus tells Amos to trust him, but Amos refuses. As Scorpius and Albus walk away, Delphi tells her Uncle that he should trust them because they are the only people who are volunteering to save his son. When Amos asks Albus what he gains from helping, Albus tells him that he knows what is like to be the unwanted child; his son didn’t deserve to die. Amos accepts and Delphi accompanies them to retrieve the Time-Turner from the Ministry.</p>
<p>Hermione tells Harry, Ginny, and Ron that she has told Draco multiple times that the Ministry is not responsible for these rumors about Scorpius. Ginny says that when Astoria died she sent Draco an owl and invited Scorpius to stay over at their house for Christmas break. He replied by telling her to tell Harry to refute the allegations about his son’s parentage. Hermione thinks he is obsessed, but Ginny thinks that he is a grieving mess. Ron jokingly tells Harry that maybe his scar is hurting because he is worried about Albus, or because he is getting old. Hermione said that they need to prepare in case some part of Voldemort is rising again. Suddenly an owl drops a letter from Professor McGonagall in Harry’s lap. The letter says that Albus and Scorpius never made it to school.</p>
<p>Scorpius hesitates drinking a bottle of Polyjuice Potion prepared by Delphi, afraid of the pain and taste as Delphi transforms into Hermione. Albus and Scorpius transform into Ron and Harry. Scorpius as Harry jokes around, pretending to punish his son. Then Delphi, Scorpius, and Albus enter the telephone booth entrance to the Ministry of Magic.</p>
<p>Harry, Hermione, Ginny, and Draco reunite. The Ministry has been looking for Albus and Scorpius. Hermione tells them that the Trolley Witch is furious and that she informed the Muggle Prime Minister to be on the lookout for two missing students. Draco asked her if she told him about Harry’s scar hurting again and she said no, because it had nothing to do with Albus and Scorpius’s disappearance. Draco then tells him that Scorpius is a follower, not a leader, and that it must have been Albus that convinced him to jump out of the train. Ginny tells him that she is sure that Albus ran away since he and Harry had a fight the night before. Draco threatens Harry, warning trouble if anything happened to his son and declares that Harry has always been a curse on his family.</p>
<p>Scorpius (as Harry), Delphi (as Hermione), and Albus (as Ron) enter the Ministry. They are on their way to Hermione’s office when the real Hermione appears on the scene. Delphi and Scorpius hide while Albus distracts his Aunt Hermione. Hermione sees Ron/Albus and is surprised to see her husband in the Ministry. In a bit of classic theater farce, Hermione and Ron/Albus talk while he blocks the entrance to her office, where Scorpius and Delphi where hiding. Hermione asks why he is blocking the door, so in a desperate move, he tells her that they should have another baby or a holiday. Hermione tries to enter to her office, but Albus/Ron kisses his Aunt as a distraction. She tells him that his breath reeks of fish and leaves without entering her office. Albus waits until Hermione leaves and opens the door to the office.</p>
<p>In Hermione’s office, Delphi ponders where Hermione would hide a Time-Turner. Since the office is filled with bookcases, it must be inside of a book. Scorpius grabs a book on Divination, a class Hermione hated. Opening the book reveals a talking riddle. The book then tries to swallow Delphi, and finally the entire bookcase tries to devour them. They answer the first riddle (Dementors!) then Albus grabs a book on Dementors and reveals a new riddle. Then Delphi reappears as her true self and solves the next riddle (Voldemort!). While Scorpius was looking for a book on Voldemort, the bookcase swallows Albus, and the Voldemort book reveals the final riddle. Scorpius solves the last riddle, revealing the Time-Turner inside the book.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-1"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>The events of the last section create the perfect storm for Albus to rebel against his father. After being told that Harry wishes he wasn’t his son, his natural instinct to play the hero himself in saving Cedric from the mistakes of his father shows emotional logic. He wants to be the hero his father never saw him as. The tactics he uses to convince Amos that he is the person to take on the mission allow him to confront all of the criticisms they’ve heard at Hogwarts; Amos brings up that he is only relying on his family’s name, that he’s the Slytherin Potter outcast, and that his only ally is the potential son of Voldemort.</p>
<p>Albus’s decision to help Amos Diggory is a way of trying to fix the mistakes his father made. Albus might be playing the hero to show that he is worthy of love. He describes himself as the “spare” son, making an allusion to what Voldemort called Cedric before his murder. Albus’s ultimate desire is to have a good relationship with his father; he knows that even a small thing like preventing Cedric’s death could change Harry’s view of him. Ultimately, Albus’s vulnerability in this moment makes him susceptible to the will of Delphi.</p>
<p>The mystery surrounding Delphi emerges in this moment. She’s one of the only characters who is not from the original series, so her presence is noteworthy. She seems at times awkward and unsure, but also influential and calculating. She convinces her uncle quickly to take the boys up on their offer of saving Cedric. She quickly develops the plan to steal the Time-Turner and executes it precisely. The sense of any concealment is balanced against the fact that the adventuring trio she forms with Albus and Scorpius parallels the adventuring trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione in the original series.</p>
<p>In a bit of typical stage farce, we see the sticky situation of having duplicates of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. We have a moment of comedy in the adventure, as we watch “Ron” try different tactics to keep Hermione out of her office. He starts with simple distractions, pretending to surprise her at work, then moving on to wanting to discuss how Harry told Albus that he wasn’t his son. The irony of using his own pain as a distraction shows the desperation of the moment. He moves on to grand gestures, asking to go on a holiday or have another baby, before he kisses his own Aunt as a way to turn her away from the office.</p>
<p>The final sequence is classic Harry Potter; a series of riddles to unlock a prize, with an imminent threat of physical danger. The bookcases coming to life tests the limits of our imagination—we as readers are inspired to wonder what stage wizardry brings this sequence to life. The riddles also foreshadow the challenges to come, from the Dementors to the specter of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#lord-voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>  himself.</p>
<h1 id="act-two-scene-1-9">Act Two, Scene 1-9</h1>
<h2 id="summary-2"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>In a dream, young  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>  is revealed sleeping in the Cupboard under the stairs at Privet Drive. His Aunt Petunia wakes him up because the pots he cleaned weren’t clean enough. Harry gets up from the bed when she notices that he wet the bed, she begins insulting him, saying that only animals and disgusting little boys wet the bed. He tells her that he was dreaming about his parents, how he saw them die. She reminds him that if he was truly reliving their death, he would hear the sound of a car accident. The dream begins dissolving into something else, and we see Albus staring at young Harry, then the voice of Voldemort hissing “Harry Potter.”</p>
<p>Harry wakes up and illuminates the staircase as Ginny enters and tells him that there isn’t any news involving Albus. He tells her that he was dreaming that he was under the stairs and he heard the voice of Voldemort. He also saw Albus wearing Drumstrang robes, and he begins to think he knows where his son could be.</p>
<p>Harry tells McGonagall that he dreamt that his son was somewhere in the Forbidden Forrest. Suddenly, Hermione enters through the chimney using Floo Powder and asking if she can assist. Ginny is working on printing an emergency edition of the  <em>Daily Prophet</em>, asking for volunteers. Then Ron bursts through the door…he too used Floo Powder, but landed in the kitchen and ate some food. Typical Ron. Suddenly the chimney rumbles and Draco pops out. The whole gang is here. Harry is surprised by Draco’s change of heart, believing in his dreams for the first time. Draco snarks that he still doesn’t believe him, but Harry Potter is always where the action is and he would do anything to get his son back.</p>
<p>Scorpius, Albus, and  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  are in the Forbidden Forrest. Delphi is teaching Albus the Disarming spell “Expelliarmus.” Incidentally, this is the first time he is actually doing a good job at casting spells. Scorpius observes his friend talking to Delphi; part of him likes it and the other part doesn’t. Delphi says Albus is becoming a good wizard; he tells her that she should stick around and teach them more spells. There is a slight flirtation, and Delphi says that she’s not going anywhere without them since they are all friends now. Albus comes up with a plan: all they have to do is make sure that Cedric loses the First Task, so he doesn’t get killed in the Third. Albus is going to disarm Cedric before he distracts the dragon and wins the task. Delphi gives them two school uniforms; Albus and Scorpius wear Durmstrang robes, because if they use Hogwarts uniforms people are expected to know who they are. Scorpius tells Delphi to let them go back in time on their own. Delphi doesn’t want to stay behind and momentarily gets upset, before calming down. She wishes them luck, that they have the opportunity to change history and give an old man his son back. She kisses Albus on the cheeks and leaves him blushing. Scorpius is slightly jealous.</p>
<p>Harry calls for Albus in the Forbidden Forest until he finds  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#bane">Bane</a>, a centaur. Bane tells him that it wasn’t a good idea to trespass on centaur land, which was given to them after the Battle of Hogwarts as a gift of gratitude for helping defeat Voldemort. Harry tells him that his son is missing and he needs help finding him. Bane tells him that he saw his son in the movements of the stars, and that his son has a black cloud around him, which could endanger him and the entire wizard community. Harry redoubles his search for his son.</p>
<p>At the Edge of the Forbidden Forest, Scorpius tells him that since the first time he heard about Hogwarts, he has wanted to go; his father didn’t like it, but he still wanted to go. All he wanted was to go to Hogwarts and have a crazy adventure like Harry Potter and his friends, and he hoped that Harry’s son might be one of his friends. Albus reminds Scorpius that he is not like his father, but Scorpius tells him that he is better, because he is his best friend. Then, Ron’s voice calls Albus’ name. Albus and Scorpius use the Time-Turner and travel back in time.</p>
<p>They travel back to 1994 to the first Tri-wizard Tournament task. The task was to retrieve a golden egg from a nest protected by a dragon. Hermione tells Scorpius to stop breathing on her. Scorpius asks “Rose” what she’s doing in 1994, before Albus realizes that it’s his Aunt Hermione in her fourth year at Hogwarts. He tells her that his friend confused her with another person and calls her Hermione; she asks how he knew her name. Before they draw more suspicion, the sound of a dragon roar distracts them all and Scorpius starts to get concerned because the Time-Turner is starting to shake.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>  is close enough to grab the dragon egg when Albus extends his arm and disarms him. Scorpius tells Albus that there is something wrong with the Time-Turner; suddenly a flash of light appears, and the boys are transported back to the present. Albus screams in pain; Scorpius realizes that the Time-Turner must have a time limit. Albus asks if it worked just as his parents and uncle arrive. Albus asks if he did something wrong before collapsing on the floor.</p>
<p>While Albus sleeps, Harry addresses the portrait of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#albus-dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>  in the Hospital Wing, saying that sometimes he looks at his portraits, but they are empty. Dumbledore speaks to him, saying that he occasionally likes to visit his other portraits. Dumbledore asks Harry about his son, and he tells him that Madam Pomfrey was able to reset his arm. Dumbledore tells him that it must be difficult to watch his child in pain. Harry responds by apologizing for never having asked him about naming Albus after him; Dumbledore tells him that it seemed like a great weight to put on him. Harry asks him how can he protect his son, and Dumbledore tells him to see Albus for who he is. He believes that Harry has been blinded by his love for him. Albus wakes up, and Dumbledore leaves; Albus tells him that he and Scorpius wanted to start living in the Muggle world instead of going back to Hogwarts. Harry tells him that he needs to stay away from  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#scorpius-malfoy">Scorpius Malfoy</a>  because he is dangerous and he might be the black cloud Bane described. Harry gives Professor McGonagall the Marauder’s Map to follow his every move; during breaks Algbus will stay in the Gryffindor Common Room and she will check up on him. Albus tells his father that he can’t go into Gryffindor because he is a Slytherin. Harry tells him to stop playing games; in this reality, Gryffindor is his House. Meanwhile his department will be investigating Scorpius’s true heritage.</p>
<p>On the Hogwarts staircase, Albus runs into Ron. Albus asks his Uncle to make a joke; Ron doesn’t know any jokes. Albus tells him that’s impossible because he runs a joke shop. Ron seems confused when he says that, but he tells Albus that he brought him a gift: a brand new set of quills. He wanted to bring him some sweets, but his wife Padma thought it was better to get him school supplies. Albus is shocked to hear that he has an Aunt Padma. Ron reveals that he came to Hogwarts because his son Panju was in trouble. Albus tells him incredulously that he was married to Hermione. Ron laughs tells him that his cousin Panju bet that he wouldn’t get sorted into Gryffindor, so he asked the Sorting Hat to place him in Gryffindor to prove his cousin wrong. Scorpius arrives and asks Albus if he’s alright, and Albus tells Scorpius that they were better off apart than together.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-2"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Dreams play a significant part in this play beyond simply revealing character or providing flashbacks: they provide the characters with new information. Harry dreams of living back in Privet Drive with his Aunt and Uncle. This was a traumatizing time for Harry, suggesting a parallel between his misery and his son’s misery at the beginning of the play. Aunt Petunia appears, insulting Harry and trashing the memory of his parents. Encouraging the comparison, Albus appears and juxtaposes their two childhoods and giving Harry the sense that his son is in danger. After seeing his clothing he realizes where exactly he might be. The device of dreams serves a necessary function by providing information not only to the audience, but also to the main characters.</p>
<p>An aspect of the play that will be scrutinized by readers of the original series is the characterization of the main characters as adults. Even though the trio has grown, many of their core qualities remain intact. Harry remains slightly disorganized but determined, Hermione remains clever and ambitious, and Ron is always quick with a joke and loves eating. In many ways, their banter mirrors the banter between the two friends, Albus and Scorpius.</p>
<p>Delphi’s friendship and magical tutelage completes an aspiration that Albus and Scorpius share: for each of them to be accepted as a friend by someone besides each other. We see Albus’s confidence grow as he succeeds in casting a spell in the Forbidden Forest in preparation for their trip back in time. The budding friendship between Albus and Delphi creates tension between the boys; Scorpius doesn’t like the attention shared, and it seems to threaten their friendship.</p>
<p>The implications of meddling in the past have long-term effects on the future, as we begin to see. Cedric’s failure in the First Task creates ripples beyond his own life. Time traveling laws dictate that one must not communicate with other people in the past, thus Scorpius and Albus talking to young Hermione will likely bring repercussions. In an example of dramatic irony, Scorpius addresses Hermione as Rose. The audience is in on the joke.</p>
<p>In the present, Harry watches his son in the hospital wing as he talks to the portrait of Albus Dumbledore. Dumbledore was a man who spoke in riddles and his portrait does the same. Dumbledore says that Harry is putting too much pressure on his son, expecting him to be something that he is not. Dumbledore expresses dismay that in naming his son after two accomplished wizards, he creates a set of very high expectations which might cause his son to worry that he might not do justice to the original bearers of the names.</p>
<h1 id="act-two-scenes-10-20">Act Two, Scenes 10-20</h1>
<h2 id="summary-3"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>  gives McGonagall the Marauder’s Map, which shows the movements of everyone in Hogwarts, so she can make sure that Albus and Scorpius stay far apart. At first, she declines to use it because she knows that Albus doesn’t have a curse on him, but Harry told her what Dumbledore said. She reminded him that Dumbledore died many years ago and that the portrait that he speaks to is not Dumbledore himself. Harry tells her to use the Map or he will return to the school and add more rules by full force using the Ministry. She grudgingly agrees.</p>
<p>Albus enters his next class, Defense Against the Dark Arts, where he finds his “Aunt” Hermione. She tells him that he must refer to her as Professor Granger. Hermione explains the Patronus Charm and Albus continues to express confusion. She begins to get annoyed and deduct house points from Gryffindor. Albus is incredulous at how mean she’s being, so Hermione deducts twenty more points to assure that she is indeed mean.</p>
<p>Scorpius looks for Albus all around Hogwarts, but when they finally meet, Albus avoids him. Albus is clearly unhappy and conflicted as he refuses to acknowledge his friend.</p>
<p>At the Potters’, Harry and Ginny are having a discussion when Draco knocks on the door; he enters and demands that Harry let Albus and Scorpius be friends again. Harry says that he is only protecting his son from what  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#bane">Bane</a>  described as a black cloud around him. Draco asks what was he implying and Harry asks Draco if Scorpius was truly his son. Draco takes offense and he and Harry start dueling, only to be stopped by Ginny reentering the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  arrives at the Hogwarts staircase and finds Scorpius; she is amazed to see all the wonders inside of Hogwarts. Scorpius asks her if she had been to Hogwarts, and she tells him no. As a child she was far too ill to go to school. She then tells him that after Cedric lost the first task it made him more motivated to win the second task, so they have to travel back again.</p>
<p>Draco apologizes to Ginny for destroying the kitchen, she quips that it isn’t her kitchen since Harry does most of the cooking. Then Draco tells Harry that he was always jealous of the friendship Harry had with Ron and Hermione; Ginny reveals that she felt the same thing. Harry tell Draco that he needs to protect his son and Draco counters that his father tried to protect him, but his ideas caused Draco to be a lonely child, like Tom Riddle (Voldemort). Draco insists that the black cloud Bane saw was Albus’ loneliness. Harry thinks and Ginny insists they travel to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Scorpius confronts Albus, saying they changed things and now they have to fix them. He points out that Ron and Hermione never got married, meaning Rose and Hugo were never born. Originally, Hermione was supposed to go to the ball with  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#viktor-krum">Viktor Krum</a>  from Durmstrang which caused Ron to became jealous, and thus began their romance. However, in this alternative timeline, she refused to go to the ball with Viktor because of the two suspicious Durmstrang boys she saw at the Tri-wizard event (aka Scorpius and Albus).</p>
<p>In the library, Professor McGonagall sees the boys together on the Maurader’s map and goes halfheartedly to tell them to separate. But Albus hides under his brother’s Invisibility Cloak with Scorpius and she ceases her search. Later, Albus tells Scorpius that the Ministry is investigating rumors of his parentage, but he tells him that he’s sure that Voldemort is not his father because Voldemort couldn’t have a nice son like Scorpius. Albus tells Scorpius that they have to return to the second task and humiliate Cedric, so they go to the girls’ bathroom.</p>
<p>Ron is walking down the staircase when he bumps into Hermione. His son Panju got into trouble in Potions class mixing the wrong ingredients causing him to grow a large mustache. Ron changes the subject by telling her that Albus thought that they were both married and had children. They both agreed that it was strange since they are both friends. Just friends. There is clear tension between the two.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall taps the Marauder’s Map with her wand and Harry and Ginny arrive through the fireplace. She tells Harry that she wants no part of using the map anymore, and he apologizes, telling her that he should never have threatened her. Then, Draco arrives, telling McGonagall that he needs to see his son. McGonagall activates the map and sees that they are both in the girls’ bathroom.</p>
<p>Albus explains his plan to Scorpius in the girls’ bathroom. They have to travel to the second task, where the competitors had to retrieve something from the lake.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>  used a Bubble-Head Charm to swim through the lake, so all they have to do is engorge his bubble-head so he will float out of the water. A jet of water emerges from the sink and the ghost of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#moaning-myrtle">Moaning Myrtle</a>  appears. She takes offense at being called Moaning Myrtle and reminds them that her name is Myrtle Elizabeth Warren. She tells them it’s been a long time since boys visited her bathroom, and flirts with them about how much she liked their parents and Cedric. They are not enthused by Myrtle Elizabeth Warren’s flirtations, but nevertheless she persisted. Albus asks her if she knows a way out of the bathroom pipes that lead to the lake, and tells her that they plan to travel back in time, but that this was secret she had to keep. She points him to the sink which empties directly into the lake. Albus pulls out Gillyweed, a plant that allows its consumer to breathe underwater. Before taking the Gillyweed Albus reminds him that they only have five minutes before they travel back to the present. Albus and Scorpius take Gillyweed and disappear down the bathroom pipes just as Harry, Draco, Ginny, and McGonagall arrive at the bathroom. Draco asks Myrtle how their sons are disappearing off the map, she tells them that they were using a “thingy" and their sons were trying to save a boy named Cedric Diggory. McGonagall reminds her that he died years ago, but Harry tells her that Albus heard him talking to  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#amos-diggory">Amos Diggory</a>  and he also knows that the Ministry has a Time-Turner.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius travel back to the Second Task of the Tri-wizard Tournament. The competitors had to retrieve a hostage underwater in under an hour, so the competitors had to breathe underwater. Cedric Diggory used the Bubble-Head Charm so Scorpius and Albus use an Engorgement Charm, causing the Bubble to wrap over his body and float out of the lake, causing him to lose the task. He flies up in the sky just as fireworks that spell “Ron loves Hermione” boom over the crowd. Scorpius cheers and returns to the surface. Albus hasn’t resurfaced yet, and Scorpius looks for him. The voice of a woman tells him to get out of the lake: it’s  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#dolores-umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, the new Headmistress of Hogwarts. He tells her that he was looking for his friend Albus Potter; she replies that there hasn’t been a Potter at Hogwarts for years, since Harry Potter was defeated by  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#lord-voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>  in the Battle of Hogwarts twenty-two years ago. She tells him to get out of the Lake because he is upsetting the Dementors and ruining Voldemort Day.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-3"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>This is our first taste of an alternate future in the play, and though the alterations are slight, they are important. We see how the ripple effect of Scorpius and Albus posing as Durmstrang students ends up preventing the very marriage of Ron and Hermione, therefore deleting Rose and Hugo from history. From the marriage of Ron and Padma comes Panju, a mischievous cousin to Albus who bets him that he wouldn’t be able to get in to Gryffindor, this changing Albus’s entire trajectory as Slytherin and negatively affecting his relationship with Scorpius.</p>
<p>We learn further that the fact that Albus is now in Gryffindor does not repair relations with his father. In this reality, there is still just as much if not more friction between Harry and Albus. This serves as a lesson going forward that Albus cannot find a simple answer for his troubles with his father. It allows him to start to understand the complexities of the father-son relationship.</p>
<p>We also see that the future can change not only people’s fates, but their personality. The version of Hermione in this future is tough, mean, and bitter. She is an unmarried Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts now since her suspicions with the “Durmstrang students” Albus and Scorpius lead to her mistrust Viktor Krum and opt to go to the ball with Ron instead. This leads to their relationship turning platonic. Although she is mean to Albus, she still melts when she meets Ron in the halls of Hogwarts. She mentions the reference Albus makes to them being married and there is a moment of undeniable tension, even in the different reality. Love, it seems, transcends time and space.</p>
<p>The use of the Marauder’s map for the surveillance of the boys causes an ethical dilemma for McGongall and allows us to see some of the simmering nastiness in this version of Harry. He not only threatens her to try to force her to spy on his son against her will; he insults her. He claims that because she doesn’t have any children, she could never understand what it feels like. This claim wounds McGonagall. As somewhat of a parental figure to Harry, she is surprised by his callousness. This results in her lukewarm execution of his orders; she feels the punishment of isolating Albus from his only friend does not quite fit the crime.</p>
<p>Even with the clear changes that are brought on by their attempt to change the First Task, the boys still plot with Moaning Myrtle Elizabeth Warren (Rowling, clearly, is a strong progressive) to undo the damage they’ve done and yet still continue to attempt to save Cedric. This example of naivety from the boys is charming, but the readers get a sense that continuing to meddle with the past will yield bad results. The first iteration of the world where Albus is in Gryffindor foreshadows the big changes yet to come, as we come to find at the end of the first play that they have inadvertently shifted the entire course of Wizarding History. Scorpius submerges himself in the lake, and when he reemerges he finds Albus gone, and a new holiday called Voldemort Day.</p>

<h2 id="summary-4"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Scorpius enters Headmaster  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#dolores-umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>’s office with a different set of clothes. Umbridge tells him that she always saw him as a Head Boy, since he is a natural leader and a great Quidditch player. However, since she found him out at the lake three days ago, she’s noticed that he has an obsession with  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>, and is constantly asking people about  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>  and the Battle of Hogwarts. She asks him if there is something she can do to get the old Scorpius back. Scorpius tells her that he will soon return to normal. Umbridge smiles and places her hand to her heart and says “For Voldemort and Valor.”</p>
<p>Scorpius walks around the Hogwarts grounds, where he bumps into Karl Jenkins and Yann Fredericks. They remind him that tomorrow night they were going to torture the Mudbloods (Muggleborns) in the dungeons and Scorpius is surprised to learn that it was his idea. Then  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#polly-chapman">Polly Chapman</a>  invites the Scorpion King to the Blood Ball and then uses the word “Potter” as a curse word because her shoes had blood on them. She then says that the Augury tells them that their future was theirs to make, and she is making hers with him. Polly exits by saying “For Voldemort and Valor” and Scorpius repeats her.</p>
<p>Scorpius enters the office of the Head of Magical Law Enforcement,  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#draco-malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, Scorpius’ father. Draco gets angry because his son kept him waiting and did not apologize. He demands that Scorpius not humiliate him at Hogwarts by asking questions about Harry Potter. Scorpius asks if Draco was involved in the Muggle-Born death camps, and asks how his mother felt about it. Draco tells him not to use his mother’s name in vain. Draco reveals that had no part in the Muggle Death camps and his wife was sympathetic to Muggle-borns; Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father, didn’t like her because she was too Muggle-loving, but Draco defied his own father for her. She thought it was the bravest thing she ever saw. Scorpius tells him that he doesn’t want to be the person he is now; he wants to be more like her. Draco tells him that his mother always helped him find the light in the darkness and overcome the “murky” circumstances. Draco tells his son that whatever he plans to do, to do it safely because he doesn’t want to lose him too.</p>
<p>Scorpius is in the Hogwarts library trying to find out how Cedric became a Death Eater, when Craig Bowker Jr. asks him why he’s there. Scorpius asks why he can’t be at the library, and Craig grovels and apologizes that Scorpius’s Potions homework wasn’t ready. Scorpius realizes that Craig does his homework for him in this new reality. Craig tells him that Professor Snape’s homework is very difficult, but he is honored to do the Scorpion King’s homework. Scorpius grabs a copy of “A History of Magic” and and realizes that Snape must still be alive.</p>
<p>Scorpius enters the Potions classroom, where he meets  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#severus-snape">Severus Snape</a>  and asks him if he is still working for Dumbledore. He denies working for him, telling him that Dumbledore is dead, and he only worked for him when he was Headmaster of Hogwarts. Scorpius tells him that he knows that he spied on Death Eaters for Dumbledore and killed him as part of his plan. He tells him the story about the Time-Turner and that he lives in a world where Harry Potter defeated Voldemort. Snape tells him that Harry Potter was the winner of the Tri-wizard Tournament. Scorpius tells him that Cedric was supposed to win too, but they humiliated him and he became a Death Eater. Snape tells him that Cedric has only killed one wizard and it was Neville Longbottom. Scorpius realizes that Neville was supposed to kill Nagini, Voldemort’s snake and the last Horcrux, before Voldemort died. Snape doesn’t believe him until Scorpius reveals that he knows that Snape loved Lily Potter: a secret only Dumbledore knew. Snape replies that Harry is dead. Scorpius tells him that Harry said he was the bravest man he ever met and named his son Albus Severus after him. Snape is deeply moved by this; Snape takes out his wand and locks the door. He tells him that they need to go to a hidden room in the roots of the Whomping Willow.Scorpius is pinned to the table by warrior-Hermione; she is now a rebel leading the resistance against Voldemort. Snape tells him that Scorpius is trustworthy and that Hermione was always a bore and an average student. Hermione lets Scorpius go and he tells them that it is his fault that they are living in this version of the world. Before he can explain, Ron enters through the door, notices Scorpius, and points his wand at him. Hermione and Snape explain that Scorpius is on their side.</p>
<p>Hermione looks at the Time-Turner, while Ron is trying to understand why their future rests on Neville Longbottom. Ron tells Scorpius that they are the only ones who can help, since they have barely five members in Dumbledore’s Army and he and Hermione are fugitives. Scorpius explains that in the other reality Harry is the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and Hermione is the Minister for Magic. Hermione is obviously happy to hear this. Ron asks what he does for a living. He explains him that he runs the Weasleys’ joke shop, but he is mostly a stay-at-home dad. Scorpius then tells him that he is married to Hermione. Hermione then asks about Snape’s fate, but before Scorpius can answer, Snape interjects that he is presumably dead, since Scorpius was so surprised when he saw him. The four of them venture to the edge of the Forbidden Forest to block the spell Albus used to prevent Cedric from succeeding in the first task. Snape warns Hermione that the dementors will be looking for her, but she doesn’t care.</p>
<p>We now see the same sequence as in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Hermione sees Albus beginning to cast his spell on Cedric’s wand. Hermione blocks the spell before he successfully casts it, allowing Cedric to win the task.</p>
<p>Hermione, Scorpius, Ron, and Snape return back to the Forbidden Forrest. Ron begins feeling pain; Scorpius tells him that Albus got hurt during their trip as Snape warns them that they are in public where the dementors can find them, but too late; the dementors are already descending on the group. Hermione knows that they are only looking for her. She declares her love to Ron and tells them all to run; she’ll stay behind and let the dementors suck out her soul. Snape and Scorpius flee, but Ron stays behind. He likes the idea of both of them being married and having children. Hermione tells him to kiss her and the pair kiss as the Dementors suck out their souls.</p>
<p>Snape and Scorpius continue to run, but a Dementor appears in front of Scorpius. Snape tells him to think of the thing he loves. He begins to hear his mother dying, and he knows he can’t defeat the dementor. Snape reminds him he is doing this to save Harry Potter and his friend. Snape tells him that he is helping the cause that Lily Potter believed in. Suddenly, Dolores Umbridge arrives and tells him that Hermione was caught by the Dementors. They both act happy, but Umbridge knows that she was with Snape and Scorpius. Snape tries to leave, telling Umbridge that they are late for class. She stops them, pointing out that they are on their way to the lake instead of the school. Snape realizes that she knows about his true allegiance; Umbridge confirms she suspected for years that Snape was against Voldemort’s rule. Snape disarms her and casts a Patronus. Scorpius sees his Patronus, a doe, like Lily Potter’s Patronus. Snape tells him to run, but asks him to tell Albus that he is proud that he carries his name. Scorpius runs into the lake and activates the Time-Turner; he ascends to the surface and so does Albus. Scorpius is overjoyed to see Albus, but Albus reminds him that he saw him two minutes ago. Scorpius hugs Albus and checks his school uniform––he’s wearing Slytherin robes! Harry and company arrive and ask what happened, as Scorpius realizes he’s lost the Time-Turner in the lake.</p>
<p>After the entire story is explained to Professor McGonagall, she considers expelling the boys, but wryly states that it would be safer if they remained under her care. So she gives them detention for the rest of the year, cancels their Christmas, and bans them from going to Hogsmade. Suddenly, Hermione enters through the door and McGonagall quips that she wishes she could give Hermione a detention for keeping an illegal Time-Turner in a bookcase. The Headmistress tells the boys that their intentions to save Cedric were honorable, but not if the entire wizarding world would enter into dark times. Lastly she tells everyone to get out of her office and find the Time-Turner.</p>
<p>Albus is sitting in his room in the Slytherin dormitory when his father enters. Harry tells him that they haven’t found the Time-Turner yet, then asks him why he traveled back in time in the first place. Albus tells him that he wanted to change things and that what happened to Cedric was unfair. Harry agrees, but says that Albus didn’t have to risk his life, and what he did was stupid and reckless. However, Harry apologizes for thinking that Scorpius was the son of Voldemort and the black cloud that  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#bane">Bane</a>  spoke of. Harry tells Albus how scared both he and Ginny were. Albus retorts that he thought that Harry Potter wasn’t scared of anything. Albus tells his father that after saving Cedric from the first task, he was sorted into Gryffindor, but they still were fighting, so that meant that him being sorted into Slytherin was not the root of their problem. Harry tells him that being sorted into Slytherin is not the reason why they argue. They both acknowledge that neither of them are satisfied with their current relationship.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-4"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, the audience is able to see a truly troubling alternate reality: a world without Harry Potter. Though we don’t see the world outside of Hogwarts, we get a sense of the rules of the world through what qualities are valued. It’s clear that in this world, Scorpius, as “The Scorpion King,” is very different from his real self: he is a bully, he has no interest in school, he engages in torture. However, on the flip-side, he is popular, he is a gifted Quidditch player, and he is pursued by girls as the ultimate boyfriend.</p>
<p>Albus has been the driving force of the story up to this point, and this section spent with Scorpius really gives a window onto the latter’s character. Not once do we see any hint that Scorpius might be tempted to remain in this new life where he has a higher status. His integrity and love for his friend Albus guides him. He seems genuinely surprised by his double’s malicious ways, and though it first seems like he is letting the other characters dictate what he is trying to do, we realize that he is simply gathering information in order to find the most effective way to rectify his mistakes and return to the past.</p>
<p>The scene with Draco as the Head of Magical Law Enforcement shows that the essence of characters stays the same, even under vastly different circumstances. Here Scorpius confronts Draco about the crimes being committed in Voldemort’s world and presses him on his involvement in alleged Mudblood death camps and Muggle killings. Draco, we learn, is not simply compliant with a pro-muggle world in the version where Hermione is Minister for Magic; his moral compass is driven by his late wife’s compassion, and his love for her. Draco seems proud of his son for challenging the cruel customs, but ultimately his brutality is driven by his fear of losing his son and wife.</p>
<p>The themes of the enduring power of love come into play especially in this act. We meet Snape, who is still the potions master, and though it seems he is different, ultimately his love for Lily Potter still drives him to look for Dumbledore and motivates him to help Scorpius return the world to the one where Harry Potter is alive and he is dead. This enduring power of love also exists with Ron and Hermione: even though they never married in this reality, the very suggestion from Scorpius triggers a deep love in them the leads them to sacrifice their lives together. It is part of the narrative of the original series; love ultimately trumps magic, dark or otherwise.</p>
<p>When Scorpius sets things right again, we return to our main character conflict between Albus and his father. The scene where Harry visits Scorpius in the common room is the setting for their first interaction since their fight, where they declared that they wished they weren’t father and son. One of the major steps in their relationship is coming to terms with their own faults: Harry realizes that Scorpius isn’t the black cloud, Albus realizes that his father never volunteered for adventure for selfish purposes, and Albus points out that their conflicts in an alternate reality still existed regardless of what house he was sorted into. The biggest step is the acknowledgement that there is something wrong between them.</p>
<h1 id="act-three-scene-12-21">Act Three, Scene 12-21</h1>
<h2 id="summary-5"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Young Harry and his Aunt Petunia are staring at a gravestone covered with flowers. She tells him to drop the flowers he brought so they can leave Godric’s Hallow. Harry asked her if his parents had any other friends or relatives, she said that she was their only living relative, and his parents were too obnoxious to have friends. Harry then asks her why their grave filled with flowers; she is moved but says that the wind blew flowers to their grave. Then the voice of Voldemort talks to Harry; Aunt Petunia pulls Harry away from the graveyard. The hand of Voldemort rises from the graveyard, revealing his own body. Petunia begins leaving Godric Hallows, Harry turns around to see Albus standing next to Voldemort trying to reach him. Harry’s dream begins to fade when the hissing voice of Voldemort calls his name.</p>
<p>Harry wakes up. Ginny tells him that he was screaming, he tells her that his dream hasn’t stopped. He tells her that he never went to Godric’s Hallow with his Aunt Petunia. He also tells her that he saw Voldemort with Albus.</p>
<p>Scorpius wakes up Albus in his bed in the Slytherin Dormitory. He tells him that Rose kicked him in the shin when he tried to hug her, but he wasn’t too upset about it. Scorpius then tells him how glad he is to be back in this version of the world then explains that Cedric was causing fear in the alternate world. Albus admits that everything they did was stupid, and if it weren’t for Scorpius the entire wizarding world would be filled with evil. Scorpius tells him that he also helped, because Snape told him to think about Albus to summon a patronus when the dementors attacked, so it was if they were fighting together. They both agree that they should never travel through time again, then Scorpius asks him to help him destroy something: out of his pocket he reveals the Time-Turner. He didn’t trust the Ministry to destroy it since they kept it once, and they might keep it again.</p>
<p>Harry and Ginny enter the Slytherin dormitory looking for Albus, but Craig Bowker Jr. stops them. He told them that they need special permission from the Headmistress to enter the dormitory. Suddenly, McGonagall appears and tells him to step aside. Harry and Ginny check the Albus’ and Scorpius’ beds, finding them empty. McGonagall starts to look for the boys when Harry tells his wife that he talked earlier to his son. She asked him what they talked about and then tells him that the more mistakes he makes it becomes harder to forgive him.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius are in the Owlery of Hogwarts, thinking of what spell they could use to destroy the Time-Turner. Suddenly,  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  appears; she says an owl sent by Albus had told her to come join them. He tells her that they were going to destroy the Time-Turner, because saving Cedric only means that the Dark Lord will rise once again. Delphi says that Cedric would have understood, suggesting they should destroy the Time-Turner together and that she was going to explain to her Uncle why they couldn’t save his son. After Albus hands her the Time-Turner, he notices a black tattoo of a bird on her back. She explains that it is an Augury: a sinister-looking black bird that cries when rain is coming and that wizards used to believe could predict death. When she was growing up, her guardian, Euphemia Rowle, used to keep one in a cage and told her that the bird was crying because she was going to die. Her guardian didn’t love her, she only wanted her for the money. Albus asks her why she tattooed herself with a bird and she explains that it reminds her that the future is hers to make. Scorpius remembers that the Rowle family were Death Eaters and, suddenly not trusting her, tells her to give him back the Time-Turner. He tells Albus that in the other world they referred to some dark force as the Augury, and quickly she takes out her wand and bounds Scorpius. He tells Albus to run, but she stops him. They ask her why she’s been manipulating them, and she tells them she’s going to remake the future as she snaps their wands in half.</p>
<p>Ron and Hermione discuss the alternative worlds; he’s shocked to find out that he and Hermione weren’t married after so many years together. He tells her that he wants to remarry her again in front of his children (and this time, sober). Harry, Ginny, and Draco enter the scene and tell them that Harry had another dream and Albus and Scorpius are missing again. Hermione tells him that she will send the Aurors to find them, but Ron tells her that he saw them out the night before. He was having a drink with Professor Neville Longbottom and he saw Albus near the Owlery with Scorpius and an older girlfriend. Harry asks him what color her hair was; he tells him that it was silver and blue. Harry recognized that he is referring to Delphi Diggory, the niece of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#amos-diggory">Amos Diggory</a>.</p>
<p>Harry and Draco walk into St. Oswald’s with their wands pointed at Amos Diggory and demand to know where their sons were. Harry accuses him of using his son, but Amos retorts that Harry used his son. Draco asked him where Albus and Scorpius are; Amos doesn’t know. They don’t believe him because he’s been sending owls to them, but he denies doing so. Harry told him that they were last seen on the Hogwarts tower with his niece. Amos stopped him, he tells him that he doesn’t have a niece because he and his wife don’t have any brothers or sisters. They realize what’s occurring.</p>
<p>Delphi takes Albus and Scorpius to the Quidditch pitch, where the third task of the Tri-wizard Tournament was held. She plans to take them both back in time to save Cedric again and resurrect the world Scorpius lived in. Since the first two tasks are unstable, she plans to take them to the third task where Cedric meets his end. Albus tells her that Cedric has to win the tournament, and she replies that he will be humiliated and lose—even if it takes him flying out of the maze naked on a broomstick covered with purple feathers—since it’s what made him become a Death Eater. Albus tells her that the only way he is going to do it is if she casts him the Imperius Curse, the spell to control another person. She tells him that it has to be him, not a puppet of his, so she takes out her wand and points it at Albus. He’s ready to die, but she points it at Scorpius instead and begins torturing him. Delphi tells him that she will stop when he agrees to help her humiliate Cedric. Craig Bowker Jr. runs to Albus and Scorpius and tells them that everybody has been looking for them. Albus tells him to run and get some help, but Delphi uses the Killing Curse on him. She tells them that she isn’t playing games anymore; she knows that Albus’s weakness, similar to his father’s, is friendship. If he doesn’t do what she tells him, Scorpius will die just like Cedric and Craig. Voldemort will return and the Augury will stand beside him just like the prophecy said. “When spares are spared, when time is turned, when unseen children murder their fathers: then will the Dark Lord return.” The spare refers to Cedric and the unseen child is Albus killing his father by changing the past. The Time-Turner begins spinning and transports them back in time.</p>
<p>They arrive at the last Tri-wizard Tournament task. Without wands, Scorpius and Albus are helpless. Scorpius tells Albus that he is ready to die if it will stop Voldemort from returning. But Albus reminds him that the Time-Turner has a five-minute time limit; all they have to do is delay her before she can succeed. Albus and Scorpius began running inside of the moving hedge maze; they can’t find Delphi. Then she enters by flying without a broom, demonstrating her power. She tells them they only have two minutes. They resist her orders and she tells them that the prophecy must be fulfilled. Scorpius tells her that prophecies can be broken or prevented. Delphi starts torturing him to prove to Albus she means business, until she is struck from behind by  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>, who thought the scene was a challenge as part of the Tri-wizard task. He frees the boys before returning to the challenge. Realizing that this is the only way, before he leaves Albus tells him that his father loves him very much. As he runs towards victory, Delphi takes out the Time-Turner and begins spinning it, but Albus and Scorpius managed to grab the device. They arrive at an unknown time. Delphi tells them that she agrees with Scorpius that prophecies can be broken or prevented, so she destroys the Time-Turner and flies away, trapping them in the past.</p>
<p>Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco and Ginny explore Delphi’s room. Harry tells them that Delphi has been using the Confundus Charm on Amos, so she could confuse him and act as his niece. Hermione reports that the Ministry has no record of her existence. They begin searching her room when Ginny unscrews an oil lamp which reveals a chimney. They hear hissing words, spoken in Parseltounge. Ginny asks Harry what it means. He reminds them that after Voldemort’s death, he can’t speak Parseltounge. Hermione reminds him that his scar didn’t hurt either, but now it does. Harry tries again; he now understands that it means “Welcome, Augury.” Harry closes his eyes and begins speaking. The room transforms, revealing the prophecy Delphi recited written with fluorescent paint the walls. The wall then reveals “I will rebirth the Dark. I will bring my father back.” They are all terrified now that they know that Voldemort had a daughter named Delphi.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-5"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>Once again we see this importance of dreams in this play as Harry receives crucial plot information through his dream in Godric’s Hollow (Albus is in trouble, Voldemort is on the rise) but we also learn the importance of Aunt Petunia through her repeated appearance in the dream motif. As Harry’s primary guardian, the way Petunia treats him has a significant impact on his own parenting. By trying to be different than her, he fulfills the needs he had as a child rather than the specific needs of his son. We also see glimmers from Petunia that she really did care for her sister, as witnessed by the emotion she feels at seeing the flowers and tributes from the visitors. Though we learn this dream was not based on an actual occurrence, it helps reveal character.</p>
<p>The second half of act three really ratchets up the rising action leading to the climax in Act Four. The major twist of the play is revealed in the latter half of the act. Voldemort does not have a son, as the audience has been led to expect; he has a daughter. Delphi’s deception has been shrewd, combining unsure footing and chumminess with the boys to hide her true intentions. Her cunning manipulation reveals her as more dangerous than her father. She sees and exploits the boy’s weaknesses and need to be loved.</p>
<p>We see history repeat itself here with the unnecessary death of Craig Bowker Jr. at the hands of Delphi. The parallelism between an innocent at the hands of Voldemort with Cedric and Craig’s demise highlight that the generations are not all that different: Harry and Albus (as we are learning) and Voldemort and his daughter. The desire to know and be close with their parents is a trait that binds both Albus and Delphi, and it allows her to take advantage of him.</p>
<p>Scorpius and Albus learn in the maze that Cedric actually encountered a challenge unbeknownst to anyone else; the act of saving the life of a boy being tortured. Not understanding the context of what was really going on, this act reveals the character of Cedric. Even thinking that it was a challenge in the maze, he still acted admirably. Showing the growth of the boys, they understand that they have to let him go meet his fate by winning the tournament, but give the past a humane change: letting him know that his father loves him before he dies.</p>
<p>Interestingly in the adult’s world, we see Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny working in tandem with  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#draco-malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>  in a way they never have before. This surprising coming together of forces builds on Draco’s statement that he was always jealous of what Harry, Ron, Hermione had. Ginny agrees, making it all the more important to their development as the subplot in the story: as adults they are finally getting what they always wanted as kids</p>
<h1 id="act-four-scene-1-15">Act Four, Scene 1-15</h1>
<h2 id="summary-6"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Wizards and witches cram into the Grand Meeting Room as Hermione takes the center stage. She informs them that the corpse of Craig Bowker Jr was found at Hogwarts. She has no information on the identity of the killer, but tells the crowd that they have discovered a brand new prophecy and that  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#lord-voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>  indeed has a child. Professor McGonagall is shocked and asks if this daughter of the Dark Lord was in custody. Hermione says no, because she has hidden in time with the help of an illegal Time-Turner that was stolen from her office. McGonagall begins placing the blame on Hermione, but Harry defends her and says the important thing is that they stop  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#delphi">Delphi</a>  before she rewrites history and Lord Voldemort rules the Wizarding world.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius are at a train station, asking a Stationmaster for help. Through his thick Scottish accent, they understand that they are too late to catch a train. Albus looks at the timetable and realizes where they are: October 30, 1981, the day before Voldemort killed James and Lily Potter. Albus realizes Delphi’s plan. She wants Voldemort to kill Harry. Scorpius realizes that it was his fault, because he told her that prophecies can be broken. Albus and Scorpius rush to Godric’s Hallow before Delphi can succeed.</p>
<p>Albus and Scorpius walk around Godric’s Hallow. Scorpius is shocked to learn that Albus had never seen Godric’s Hallow; Harry tried to take him several times, but he refused. Scorpius shows him St. Jerome’s graveyard and points out where the statue of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a>  and his parents will be located. Then he shows him the house of Bathilda Bagshot, author of the book “A History of Magic.” Then Albus sees the house of Lily and James Potter. He sees his grandparents with a baby and moves towards them. Scorpius stops him, reminding him that he can’t be seen without damaging time. They start to develop a plan.</p>
<p>Dumbledore appears in a portrait in Harry’s office. While arguing with him, Harry tells Dumbledore that he is letting his son down the same way that he did with him. Dumbledore tells him to be true to the people that he truly loves. Then, Draco enters and tells him that he has in his possession the real Time-Turner from Theodore Nott, and the one that Albus is using is just a prototype. His Time-Turner does not have a time limit. He tells Harry that he was hesitant to admit he possessed it because it would mean that people would believe that Scorpius was indeed Voldemort’s son. He admits that his wife’s bloodline had a blood disease passed on to each generation, therefore he hid Scorpius and his wife from society, causing people to create the rumors. Harry tells him that they both tried to give their sons what they thought they needed, not what their sons themselves truly wanted.</p>
<p>Outside of James and Lily Potter’s home, Albus and Scorpius are thinking of ideas to send a message to Harry. They cannot talk to anyone or they will risk changing the future. Albus sees Lily wrapping Harry in the blanket and he remembers that his father always held the blanket on the anniversary of his parents’ death. However, Albus realizes that he did spill Ron’s love potion on the blanket, which creates a chemical reaction. He realizes that in order for Harry to get the message they have to write it with tincture of Demiguise which is known to cause a Chemical reaction with the pearl dust in the love potion. Conveniently, Batilda Bagshot has some in her home, and always leaves her doors unlocked.</p>
<p>Ginny finds Harry sitting on Albus’s bed at home, and he tells her that he hasn’t touched anything. He tells her that this is his second worst Hallow’s Eve. He says that he shouldn’t have survived; he was supposed to die, and now it was all his fault that fifty people died trying to save him. Ginny tells him that Voldemort killed those people, not him. Harry looks at the floor and sees his blanket. He sadly mentions that it was all he had from his parents and now it was filled with holes caused by Ron’s love potion. Harry opens the blanket and Ginny notices the holes spell something out: “Dad. Help. Godric’s Hollow. 31/10/81.” Harry realizes that it’s message from Albus telling where he is in time. Harry kisses Ginny and tells her to send an owl to Draco telling him to meet them at Godric’s Hollow with the Time-Turner. Harry sends Hermione an owl telling her the same.</p>
<p>Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and Ginny arrive and walk around Godric’s Hallow in the present. Hermione remembers the last time she was there over twenty years ago. Ginny notices that it was filled with Muggles, because Godric’s Hallow has since become a famous location. The five start to break into a little fight over Draco’s past grievances but Hermione reminds them that they are all on the same team now. Draco takes out the Time-Turner and it transports them back to Godric’s Hallows in 1981.</p>
<p>Albus looks up and sees his parents, his Aunt and Uncle, and  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#draco-malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. Albus is overjoyed his parents received his note and they hug. Seeing that, Draco tells his son that they could also hug, so they do, very awkwardly. Ron asks them where Delphi is, and Albus says that she is arriving soon. Hermione says that they should hide in St. Jerome’s Church, so that they don’t attract attention.</p>
<p>Albus is sleeping when Harry express concerns to Ginny that he made Albus think he had to save the world, but Ginny corrects Harry, saying that Albus has, in fact, saved the world. She then tells him that after she opened the Chamber of Secrets, everybody ignored her once she got out of the hospital, except for him. One day he challenged her to a game of Exploding Snap in the Gryffindor Common Room and reminds him that sometimes people, including children, just need someone to see them. Harry asks what Exploding Snap had to do with him being a good father. She tells him that in that moment she felt the love from him and she is sure that Albus hasn’t felt that from him. He tells her that he’d do anything for him, but he would do anything for anybody. Albus needs to feel a specific love from him. He tells her that once he thought Albus was gone, he truly understood what his mother felt for him: a type of love that was able to repel the spell of death. In that moment, Ginny realizes that Delphi doesn’t want Harry to be killed; she wants to stop Voldemort from killing him and causing his own demise.</p>
<p>The group’s new mission is to ensure that Voldemort kills James and Lily Potter. No one knows the exact time that Voldemort visited Godric’s Hollow. Albus tells them that he is good at brewing a Polyjuice potion and that Bathilda Bagshot has ingredients in her home. What they need to do is get one of them to transfigure into Voldermort, luring Delphi. However, Ron tells him that they need a bit of Voldemort for it to work. Harry tells Hermione that they can transfigure into him manually, Ron volunteers first, then Draco and Hermione. Ginny does not since she knows what it’s like to have his voice inside of her head, but ultimately Harry decides that it has to be him. For the plan to work Delphi has to know that it’s him; she’ll use Parseltongue and Harry can speak it in reply. Hermione agrees, but Ginny and Ron reminds them that Harry could stay stuck as Voldemort forever. Harry agrees, saying that it’s the only way they can defeat Delphi. Hermione explains that the objective is to get Delphi to stand near him, so they can come out of the door and trap her. Draco looks for flaws in this plan, but Albus tells him to trust his father. Hermione and the gang join their wands and transfigure Harry into Voldemort.</p>
<p>Albus confesses to his mother that he was responsible for the whole time-traveling situation. Ginny believes that Harry was the one responsible. Ginny, Albus, Hermione, Ron, Draco, and Scorpius hide as Delphi enters the church. Delphi reveals herself to “Voldemort” as his daughter, and Harry acts the part well. However, Harry’s disguise only lasts for only a short time and Delphi becomes suspicious. When she realizes she has been tricked, she and Harry engage in a battle. She locks the door by using a Sealing Charm, leaving Harry to face her alone. She is very powerful, and Harry is soon struggling to hold his own. Albus arrives through a vent and manages to get the doors open. The others rush in and quickly defeat Delphi. She pleads to just have a chance to see Voldemort. Harry refuses. She asks to be put to death and Harry refuses that as well, noting their commitment to always taking the moral road with their enemies. They hear Voldemort approaching and Draco flicks his wand and silences Delphi.</p>
<p>Harry watches Voldemort; he knows that he is going to kill his parents, but he can’t do anything. Draco tells him that he can do something, but Scorpius and Albus tell him that he can’t save them without messing with time. Draco considers his actions to be heroic, Ginny grabs Harry’s hand and tells him that he doesn’t have to watch. Harry tells them that he is allowing it to happen, so he has to watch, then they all agree to watch with him. Voldemort kills James Potter first, we hear the screams of Lily Potter begging for her life. A green light flashes, Lily and James are dead, and so is Voldemort. Harry and his family and friends return back to the future.</p>
<p>We flash back to the wreckage of James and Lily Potter’s house.  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#hagrid">Hagrid</a>  comes in and finds James and Lily’s corpse. He begins sobbing until he hears the sound of baby Harry. He takes him out of his crib and introduces himself telling him that they are going to be friends, whether he likes it or not. Hagrid takes baby Harry out of the house…and the rest is history.</p>
<p>Scorpius and Albus run into a classroom, and are both shocked that Scorpius asked out Rose. She said no, but Scorpius claims that he planted the acorn which will eventually grow into their marriage. Albus told him that he is being a fantasist, but Scorpius reminded him that  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#polly-chapman">Polly Chapman</a>  asked him to the school ball in the alternative reality where he was popular. Albus assures him that Rose hates him, but Scorpius corrects him: she used to hate him, but now she has pity for him. For him, pity is good since it’s the start of love. Albus thought he would be the first to get a girlfriend, so Scorpius tells him that he should date the new “smokey-eyed” Potions professor since he has a thing for older women, referring to Delphi. Then Rose walks in and says hi to Albus and Scorpius, and walks off after referring to Scorpius as the “Scorpion King.” Then Scorpius invites him to watch a Quidditch match; he’s been training so that next year he can join the Slytherin team. Albus declines his invitation because he is going for a walk with his father. Scorpius seems to hugs Albus, although it’s not totally clear.</p>
<p>Harry and Albus walk on the Hogwarts grounds. He asks his son if he is ready for his fourth-year exams—he remembers it was a big year for him—but then notices that is making it about himself, so he stops. Albus tells him that he saw his parents and that they were having fun together as a family. Harry would have liked them, and so would Albus and his siblings. Harry tells him that he thought that he lost Voldemort forever, but then his scar started hurting and he felt as if he had never truly gotten rid of him. Now Harry’s priority is to be a better and more honest dad to his son. Harry reminds Albus that he once told him that he wasn’t afraid of anything, so he is going to tell him the truth. He is afraid of the dark, small spaces, and pigeons, but the thing that scares him the most is being his father. Harry does not have a role model to base himself off of as a parent, because he was an orphan. Albus promises that he was going to be a better son, but that he will never be like James and him. Harry tells him that James is nothing like him, because everything is easy for James, while Harry had a struggling childhood like Albus. But he says that Albus is more like his mother: bold, fierce, and funny. Albus reminds him that he almost destroyed the world. Harry tells him that he knows that his son is going to be a great wizard and Albus jokingly replies that he is going into pigeon racing. Harry grins and tells him that the names that he carries are not meant to be a burden: both Dumbledore and Snape were good wizards, but they also had their flaws. Albus looks around and asks why are they in a graveyard. Harry tells him that they are visiting the grave of  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#cedric-diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>. He agrees with Amos that Cedric was stolen from him and he feels guilty for getting him killed, so sometimes Harry pays a visit to his grave. Harry and Albus hug, look to the sky and agree that it is going to be a great day.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-6"><strong>Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>The rules of the prophecy and the past are tricky. From our understanding, Delphi is thwarted when Cedric wins the Tri-wizard tournament. She is forced to recalibrate her plans to prevent the death of Voldemort by taking matters into her own hands, abandoning the prospect of fulfilling the prophecy. By going back in time and modifying the past herself, she prevents Albus and Scorpius from playing their role in the prophecy. By defying the prophecy, she ultimately sets herself up for defeat.</p>
<p>The exchange between Ginny and Harry is an important one for the father/son relationship. She successfully diagnoses the cause of tension between her husband and son; she alludes to a time she felt specifically loved by Harry, when she was feeling particularly vulnerable and he offered to play a game with her, as opposed to all of the other people who he treats well in general. She realizes that Albus needs to feel that Harry is tailoring his parenting to Albus’s own needs, not just what Harry would have wanted for himself.</p>
<p>The climax of the play is a surprisingly touching moment that links the fate of two orphan children, when Harry’s parents are about to be murdered by the father of the orphan Delphi. We see her desperation to know her father and have his approval as she talks to Harry disguised as the Dark Wizard, giving the final confrontation an unexpected parallel. Delphi moves heaven and earth to have the opportunity to meet her father, no matter what the casualties. The irony is that this puts Harry in a position where he is forced make the choice not to change history and prevent the murder of his parents. Instead, he chooses life as he knows it and watches—surrounded by the people who will become, in a sense, his surrogate family—his birth parents being murdered.</p>
<p>The theme of an orphan finding a family makes Delphi an interesting foil to Harry. Harry goes to Hogwarts and makes friends who eventually become his family (literally, in Ginny’s case). The importance of those relationships stem from the fact that he has no one else as family. Delphi was raised by the Rowles, who never wanted her and never give her the chance to attend Hogwarts. Delphi was never given a chance to grow and develop relationships, therefore resorting to finding her family by changing the past.</p>
<p>The last moment of the play gives a happy ending to our heroes. Scorpius is trying (and in his mind, succeeding) at courting Rose and beginning to involve himself in extracurricular activities. Albus and Harry agree that they need to work as a team to improve their relationship, and demonstrate their commitment to bonding by spending quality time together at Hogwarts. Harry apologizes for everything that he said to his son, and beings to focus on the common ground between them. Harry also learns to be vulnerable, admitting to his son that he has fears for the first time, revealing his humanity and allowing his son to see him as a normal man with fears instead of a wizarding hero. Together as they mourn at the grave of Cedric, they express hope in the future of their relationships, buoyed by a better understanding of the other and seeing more of themselves in the other Potter.</p>
<h1 id="symbol-allegory-motif">Symbol, Allegory, Motif</h1>
<h2 id="dreams-motif">Dreams (motif)</h2>
<p>The motif of dreams throughout the play allows the reader to gain information about Harry’s character and backstory. We are able to see key moments from Harry’s life, such as Hagrid’s visit to tell him that he is a wizard, but also moments that allegedly never occurred (like Petunia’s visit to Godric’s Hollow), which reveals the essence of his relationship with his Aunt. These dreams also serve the story; they tend to be a plot device to give Harry information about the whereabouts of Albus and when he is in danger. They finish with an ominous flourish as Voldemort’s voice reminds the audience of the very real sense of danger throughout.</p>
<h2 id="the-time-turner-symbol">The Time-Turner (symbol)</h2>
<p>The Time-Turner symbolizes the hope for second chances, as well as the danger of meddling with the past. An instrument such as the Time-Turner is illegal in the Wizarding World, which is why Harry confiscates it from Theodore Nott. We come to learn that meddling with the past is illegal for good reason. That same item was later used by Albus and Scorpius to fix the past, however it ends up causing chaos in the future. Ultimately, the characters use their adventures in time to come to peace with the past, and gain hope for the future.</p>
<h2 id="harrys-blanket-symbol">Harry’s Blanket (symbol)</h2>
<p>Harry’s blanket is important because it is the only memory that he had of his mother and of his past. Holding on to that blanket gave Harry a sense of love and security, and he wanted to make sure that his own son felt that same type of comfort. Albus rejects the blanket as a gift, symbolizing how Albus rejects his father and his hero narrative. However, in the end, Albus uses the blanket as a way to send a message to his father, showing how the gift was indeed useful for their relationship after all.</p>
<h2 id="cedric’s-grave-symbol">Cedric’s Grave (symbol)</h2>
<p>Cedric’s grave symbolizes the loss of life at the hands of Voldemort, and the guilt that Harry has to suffer throughout his adult life. Cedric was one of the first people to die when Voldemort returned during Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry always felt responsible for his death, and that of many other people, before Voldemort’s final demise. In the end of the play, Harry takes Albus to the grave, so he could share his pain with his son, and also show Albus how to move on, now that he too feels the guilt at being involved in the death of another innocent Hogwarts student.</p>
<h2 id="harry’s-scar-symbol">Harry’s Scar (symbol)</h2>
<p>Throughout the play, Harry’s scar hurts several times, especially after a dream. Since the first Harry Potter story, we learned that his scar inflicts pain only when Voldemort is active. It serves as an alarm throughout the piece than danger is coming and foreshadows the conflicts to come.</p>
<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>How would you describe Harry as a parent? What contributes to Harry’s lack of parenting skills? Why has it taken Harry so long to realize that he isn’t a good father to Albus?</strong></p>
<p>Is it possible for Harry to be a bad father to Albus, but a good father to his other children? Harry Potter does not try to be a bad father; in his case, he does not quite know how to be a parent, since he didn’t have his own to look up to. Being a father is entirely new for him. Though Albus is sometimes a difficult child, these problems could be a symptom of teen angst and trying to fit in a world where people expect too much from him. During the course of the play, Harry comes to understand that Albus requires “specific love” in order to feel loved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How would you describe the relationship between Harry and Ginny Potter in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? What causes conflict in their relationship in the course of the play?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the play Harry and Ginny have been married for 17 or 18 years. Their relationship is based on mutual respect and constructive criticism; Ginny has a strong attitude regarding her children. Ginny rebukes Harry strongly when she notices that he is doing the wrong thing with his children, especially when Harry tells Albus that he wishes Albus was not his son. It is important that Ginny is never just angry at Harry for his actions; she uses her experience with excellent parents to teach him about how to be a better father. She knows that it is ultimately up to Harry and Albus to work as a team, so Harry can be the father Albus needs and also Albus can be the son Harry would feel proud of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How does Draco Malfoy change?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of the play, Draco spends his time locked in his house at Malfoy Manor, where he maintains a collection of Dark artifacts. He spends his time mourning the death of his wife, Astoria. He has a devout love for his child Scorpius Malfoy and will go to any ends to protect him. When he begins to work with his old enemy Harry Potter, he begins a transformation. When he begins to work with Harry, Draco reveals that he has always been jealous of him, not because he was the Chosen One, but because he had two best friends in Hermione and Ron, while Draco only had lackeys. Draco wished he had friends just like them, later Ginny Potter reveals that she too had the same type of envy about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who is the Cursed Child?</strong></p>
<p>The identity of the titular “Cursed Child” is debatable, because readers can interpret it to be Albus, Scorpius, Harry, or Delphi. In Albus’ case, he feels cursed living in the shadow of his father Harry Potter. People expect very much from him, but in his case he feels that he doesn’t live up to these expectations, especially because he was named after two famous and accomplished wizards, “Albus” and “Severus”.</p>
<p>In Harry’s case, we see his struggle to get past his abusive childhood, and the PTSD he suffers during the events of his teenage years. As an orphan, he has no roadmap to raise his children. He has to rely on the wisdom of his wife and the advice from friends and mentors.</p>
<p>In Scorpius’s case, he is marginalized because of the rumor regarding Voldemort possibly being his father, which caused him to be sidelined by everyone at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, during the second part of the story it is revealed that Scorpius has a disease in his bloodline, which later killed Astoria. As a result, Draco tried to keep his son safe and apart from others, which lead to the rumors that Scorpius might have been the son of Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>In Delphi’s case, she is the daughter of Voldemort, the most evil wizard who ever lived. She is cursed in the sense that his blood runs through her veins. Delphi believes in her father’s ideology, and she regrets never having met him, since he died before she could remember him. She also was raised alone and friendless, and expressed jealousy of the childhoods of Albus and Scorpius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Describe the last scene of the play. Why does Harry choose to take Albus where he does? What is the sense of their relationship at this point?</strong></p>
<p>Harry takes Albus on a hike on the Hogwarts grounds. He takes Albus to Cedric’s grave, where his father asks him if he knew Craig Bowker extremely well. He said no. His father tells him that he didn’t know Cedric as well as he could have, but that doesn’t stop him from being hurt and sorry that he was responsible for his death. Albus thought that Harry was heartless when it came to Cedric’s death, now he understands the weight his father carries. However, Harry makes it clear that he has thought about Cedric a lot and that he wonders what Cedric might have become, if he had grown into adulthood. The audience saw Harry’s regret during the first scene involving Amos, but Albus did not. Albus made an assumption based on what he felt was true. We get the sense that Harry is making an effort to spend quality time and give Albus the specific love that he needs. In the last line of the play, we get a sense of the hope they have that their relationship will be mended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Who is Delphi Diggory and what is her role in the play?</strong></p>
<p>Delphi Diggory is the niece of Amos Diggory and caretaker of her uncle at St. Oswald’s Home for Old Witches and Wizards. She helps Albus and Scorpius retrieve the Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic and teaches Albus spells in preparation for their trip back in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How does Harry Potter's relationship with his son Albus change throughout the play?</strong></p>
<p>Harry Potter's relationship with his son Albus is strained at the beginning of the play, with Albus feeling isolated from his family and struggling at Hogwarts. After a fight with his father, Albus sets out to use a Time-Turner to save Cedric Diggory. Harry searches for his son and eventually learns to see him for who he is, not blinded by his love for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What is the Time-Turner?</strong></p>
<p>The Time-Turner is a magical device that allows the user to go back in time and modify the past. In the play, Theodore Nott possesses an illegal Time-Turner that can send its user into the past for more than an hour at a time.</p>

<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p><em><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></em>  is a play written by playwright  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/author/jack-thorne">Jack Thorne</a>, directed by  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/author/john-tiffany">John Tiffany</a>, and based on an original story by  <em><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#harry-potter">Harry Potter</a></em>  author  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/author/j-rowling">J.K. Rowling</a>.</p>
<p>The story begins nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts in the epilogue scene at King’s Cross train station from the final book,  <em><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></em>. In this story, we see Harry struggling to connect with his middle son Albus, while also sustaining his job as the Head of Magical Law for the Ministry of Magic. After receiving some intel about an illegal Time-Turner, Harry works with Minister for Magic  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#hermione-granger">Hermione Granger</a>  (who is married to his best friend and brother-in-law,  <a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child/study-guide/character-list#ron-weasley">Ron Weasley</a>) to track it down. The play becomes an exploration of Harry’s relationship with his middle son, and a chase through the past to save the future.</p>
<p>Addressing her decision to create the story as a play, Rowling has said that she “is confident that when audiences see the play they will agree that it is the only proper medium for the story.” Jamie Parker from  <em><a href="https://www.gradesaver.com/the-history-boys">The History Boys</a></em>  was cast as Harry Potter, Noma Dumezweni playing Hermione Granger, and Paul Thornley playing Ron Weasley. The casting of black actress Dumezweni as the original Hermione gained praise and attention. Though the character of Hermione Granger has been portrayed as white in the movies, author J.K. Rowling tweeted in response to the casting of Dumezweni “Canon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified. Rowling loves black Hermione.”</p>
<p>The play officially premiered on July 30, 2016 at the Palace Theatre in London to rave international reviews followed by the publication of the Special Rehearsal Script the day after. The book sales of the script were highly successful, selling more copies than the original Harry Potter books in under a day. The play is slated to come to Broadway in 2018.</p>
